## Description
Write a program where two users can play Pig dice against each other. Don't forget to write plain English specifications with example inputs and outputs before you begin coding!

Further Exploration
Add options to play one of the other variations of Pig Dice using two or more dice
Add option to play the computer - easy or hard levels:
Easy: Computer always stops after second roll.
Hard: Computer uses strategy based on current total and rolled dice.

Rules of the game (from wikipedia) are as follows:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.

## Objectives
- [] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery
